# 🎬 Backend Sprint for *AGES-PUCRS* Study Group

## 🚀 Technologies Used:
- 🌱 **Prisma** – ORM for database interactions  
- 🗃️ **SQLite** – Lightweight database  
- ⚡ **Express.js** – Web framework for building APIs  
- 🟨 **JavaScript** – Backend logic  
- 🎨 **HTML & CSS** – Basic frontend interface  

## 📌 Sprint Description:
The goal of this sprint was to develop a movie API using **Express**, **Prisma**, and **SQLite**. The API allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** movies, as well as add **reviews** for specific titles.

## 🔧 Main Features:
- 📝 **CRUD** operations for movies  
- 🌟 **CRUD** operations for movie reviews  
- 🔗 Integration with **SQLite** using **Prisma**  
- 🛡️ Optional data validation through **middleware**

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project:
1. In your terminal, run:
```bash
npm install express
node server.js
```

2. Open the ```index.html``` file.

Make sure you have SQLite and node installed.

## ✅ Results:
The project was successfully completed!  

✨ As a **bonus**, a **frontend interface** was developed, allowing users to:
- View existing movies from the database  
- Create new movies and reviews via the browser  

⚠️ While the API supports deleting and updating movies/reviews, these features were not included in the frontend interface.

📁 *This sprint serves as a hands-on project to deepen backend development skills and API integration using modern JavaScript tooling.*
